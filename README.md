I'm a coder, so that explains why I'm on GitHub. I'm currently working with **Swift**, **Flutter**, and **React Native**. Previously worked with React, C#, Unity.

I love programming - developing and building experiences is extremely satisfying. There's so many areas of programming to explore and I'm constantly finding, learning, and trying out new things.
